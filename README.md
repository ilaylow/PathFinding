# PathFinding
A Path Finding Algorithm Utilising Breadth First Search.

The algorithm uses a linked list data structure in C and as well as the use of a priority queue to implement a Breadth First Search.
The algorithm only reads input of specific format. 

I hope this doesn't break your computer. Many thanks.
